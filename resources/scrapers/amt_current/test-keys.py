Determined to become a mother, she commits to a plan, makes an appointment and decides to go it alone. That same day, Zoe meets Stan (Alex O’Loughlin) – a man with real possibilities. Trying to nurture a budding relationship and hide the early signs of pregnancy becomes a comedy of errors for Zoe and creates confusing signals for Stan. When Zoe nervously reveals the reason for her unpredictable behavior, Stan commits fully and says he’s in. Never before has love seen a courtship where a wild night of sex involves three in a bed – Stan, Zoe and the ever-present massive pregnancy pillow. Or, where “date night” consists of being the “focal point” at a near-stranger’s water birth which does for kiddie pools what “Jaws” did for swimming in the ocean. The real pregnancy test comes when both of them realize they really don’t know each other outside of hormonal chaos and birth preparations. With the nine month clock ticking, both begin to experience cold feet.  Anyone can fall in love, get married and have a baby but doing it backwards in hyper-drive could be proof positive that they were made for each other.</description></info><cast><name>Jennifer Lopez</name><name>Alex O’Loughlin</name><name>Danneel Harris</name><name>Eric Christian Olsen</name><name>Noureen DeWulf</name><name>Anthony Anderson</name><name>Melissa McCarthy</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name><name>Romance</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/thebackupplan_l200912111209.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/thebackupplan_xl200912111209.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="92171836">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/thebackupplan/backupplan-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3459"><info><title>Beastly</title><runtime>0:21</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>CBS Films</studio><postdate>2009-11-24</postdate><releasedate>2010-07-30</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 CBS Films</copyright><director>Daniel Barnz</director><description>Kyle Kingson (Alex Pettyfer) has it all – looks, intelligence, wealth and opportunity – and a wicked cruel streak. Prone to mocking and humiliating “aggressively unattractive” classmates, he zeroes in on Goth classmate Kendra, inviting her to the school’s extravagant environmental bash. Kendra accepts, and, true to form, Kyle blows her off in a particularly savage fashion. She retaliates by casting a spell that physically transforms him into everything he despises. Enraged by his horrible and unrecognizable appearance he confronts Kendra and learns that the only solution to the curse is to find someone that will love him as he is – a task he considers impossible. Repulsed by his appearance, Kyle’s callous father banishes him to Brooklyn with a sympathetic housekeeper (LisaGay Hamilton) and blind tutor (Neil Patrick Harris). As Kyle ponders how to overcome the curse and get his old life back, he chances upon a drug addict in the act of killing a threatening dealer. Seizing the opportunity, Kyle promises the addict freedom and safety for his daughter Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) if she will consent to live in Kyle’s Brooklyn home.  Thus begins Kyle’s journey to discover true love in this hyper-modern retelling of the classic “Beauty and the Beast” story.</description></info><cast><name>Vanessa Hudgens</name><name>Alex Pettyfer</name><name>Mary-Kate Olsen</name><name>Neil Patrick Harris</name><name>Peter Krause</name><name>Lisa Gay Hamilton</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/beastly_l200911241337.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/beastly_xl200911241337.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="12628807">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/beastly/beastly-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3435"><info><title>Bitch Slap</title><runtime>2:29</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>IM Global and Epic Slap</studio><postdate>2009-11-16</postdate><releasedate>2010-01-08</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 IM Global and Epic Slap</copyright><director>Rick Jacobson</director><description>BITCH SLAP is a post-modern, thinking man’s throwback to the “B” Movie/Exploitation films of the 1950’s - 70’s as well as a loving, sly parody of the same. Inspired by the likes of Dragstrip Girl;, Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill; Kung Fu Nun and the pantheon of Blaxploitation films, BITCH SLAP will mix girls, guns, outrageous action and jaw-dropping visuals with a message… don’t be naughty! At its core, BITCH SLAP follows three bad girls (a down-and-out stripper, a drug-running killer and a corporate powerbroker) as they arrive at a remote desert hideaway to extort and steal $200 Million in diamonds from a ruthless underworld kingpin. Things quickly spin out of control as allegiances change, truths are revealed, other criminals arrive for the score, the fate of the world hangs in the balance and they are forced to confront a villain much worse than they ever expected… themselves. It’s the ultimate morality tale as, one by one, they realize the whole she-bang was a set-up and one of them may not even be human… What also makes BITCH SLAP different is a complicated “B” story device that runs throughout the film to illuminate character, backstory and relationship histories not previously revealed. Like the film Memento, these scene flashbacks take place in reverse, so by the end of the film, you have a wholly different take on who these women are and why they are behaving so badly.  Bet you never saw THAT in Jailbait Babysitter!</description></info><cast><name>Julia Voth</name><name>Erin Cummings</name><name>America Olivo</name><name>Michael Hurst</name><name>Ron Melendez</name><name>William Gregory Lee</name><name>Minae Noji</name></cast><genre><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/bitchslap_l200911131125.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/bitchslap_xl200911131125.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="93532109">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/bitchslap/bitchslap-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3308"><info><title>The Blind Side</title><runtime>2:30</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

Pictures’ “The Blind Side,” which depicts the remarkable true story of All-American football star Michael Oher. Teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is surviving on his own, virtually homeless, when he is spotted on the street by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). Learning that the young man is one of her daughter’s classmates, Leigh Anne insists that Michael—wearing shorts and a t-shirt in the dead of winter—come out of the cold. Without a moment’s hesitation, she invites him to stay at the Tuohy home for the night. What starts out as a gesture of kindness becomes much more as Michael becomes part of the Tuohy family despite the differences in their backgrounds. Living in his new environment, the teen faces a completely different set of challenges to overcome. And as the family helps Michael fulfill his potential, both on and off the football field, Michael’s presence in the Tuohys’ lives leads them to some insightful self-discoveries of their own. </description></info><cast><name>Sandra Bullock</name><name>Tim McGraw</name><name>Kathy Bates</name><name>Quinton Aaron</name><name>Lily Collins</name><name>Jae Head</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/wb/posters/theblindside_l200909111110.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/wb/posters/theblindside_xl200909111110.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="96085471">http://movies.apple.com/movies/wb/theblindside/theblindside-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3262"><info><title>The Book of Eli</title><runtime>2:05</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

And Clarence “Tango” Butler (Oscar® nominee Don Cheadle) has been undercover so long his loyalties have started to shift from his fellow police officers to his prison buddy Caz (Wesley Snipes), one of Brooklyn’s most infamous drug dealers.

Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) is a lifelong resident of the tiny, tradition-steeped Bronx enclave of City Island. A family man who makes his living as a corrections officer, Vince longs to become an actor. Ashamed to admit his aspirations to his family, Vince would rather let his fiery wife Joyce (Julianna Margulies) believe his weekly poker games are a cover for an extramarital affair than admit he’s secretly taking acting classes in Manhattan. When Vince is asked to reveal his biggest secret in class, he inadvertently sets off a chaotic chain of events that turns his mundane suburban life upside down. Inspired by the exercise, he decides to bring his long-lost ex-con son Tony (Steven Strait) home to meet the family, and it soon becomes clear that everyone—including his college student daughter (Dominik García-Lorido), teenaged son Vinnie, Jr. (Ezra Miller), charismatic acting partner (Emily Mortimer) and drama coach (Alan Arkin)— has something to hide. A perfect storm of deception, half truths and confusion makes Vince and his family members realize that the truth may not set them free, but it is easier to keep track of than all their well-intentioned white lies.</description></info><cast><name>Andy Garcia</name><name>Julianna Margulies</name><name>Emily Mortimer</name><name>Alan Arkin</name><name>Steven Strait</name><name>Dominik Garcia-Lorido</name><name>Ezra Miller</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/cityisland_l201001291147.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/cityisland_xl201001291147.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="92355201">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/cityisland/cityisland-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3429"><info><title>Clash of the Titans</title><runtime>1:06</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Warner Bros.

A mysterious toxin in the water supply turns everyone exposed to it into mindless killers and the authorities leave the uninfected to their certain doom in this terrifying reinvention of the George Romero horror classic. Directed by Breck Eisner (Sahara), The Crazies is written by Ray Wright (Pulse, Case 39) and Scott Kosar (The Amityville Horror, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The American Dream goes horribly wrong when the residents of this picture-perfect town begin to succumb to an uncontrollable urge for violence and the horrific bloodshed escalates into anarchy. In an attempt to contain the epidemic, the military uses deadly force to close off access into or out of town, abandoning the few healthy citizens to the growing mayhem as depraved killers lurk in the shadows. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant); his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell); Becca (Danielle Panabaker), an assistant at the medical center; and Russell (Joe Anderson), Dutton’s deputy and right-hand man, find themselves trapped in a once idyllic town they can no longer recognize. Unable to trust former neighbors and friends, deserted by the authorities and terrified of contracting the illness themselves, they are forced to band together in a nightmarish struggle for survival.</description></info><cast><name>Timothy Olyphant</name><name>Radha Mitchell</name><name>Danielle Panabaker</name><name>Joe Anderson</name></cast><genre><name>Horror</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/thecrazies_l201001111049.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/thecrazies_xl201001111049.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="72141506">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/thecrazies/thecrazies-tlr2_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3482"><info><title>Crazy On the Outside</title><runtime>2:14</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Freestyle Releasing</studio><postdate>2009-12-23</postdate><releasedate>2010-01-08</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 Freestyle Releasing</copyright><director>Tim Allen</director><description>Tommy (Tim Allen) is fresh out of prison and ready for a second chance in life.

The ambitious 24-year-old has been given a career-making assignment. His mission: Fly to London and escort a rock god to L.A.’s world famous Greek Theatre for the first-stop on a huge comeback tour. His record mogul boss, Sergio Roma (Sean Combs), gives him one warning: “The artist is the worst person on Earth. Turn your back on him at your own peril.” British rocker Aldous Snow (Brand) is a brilliant musician, but due to a bad break up and nose-diving career, has fallen off the wagon and is now a drunken disaster. Weary of “yes men” and scared he’s entered the “greatest hits” moment in his career, Snow’s in the midst of a nihilistic downward spiral. When he learns his true love, model/pop star Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), is in Los Angeles, Aldous makes it his quest to win her back…right before kick-starting his world domination. As the countdown to the concert begins, one innocent young man must navigate a minefield of London drug smuggles, New York City brawls and Vegas lap dances to deliver his charge safe and, sort of, sound… all while trying to remain faithful to his med student girlfriend (Elisabeth Moss).  He may have to coax, lie to, enable and party with Aldous, but Aaron will get him to the Greek.</description></info><cast><name>Jonah Hill</name><name>Russell Brand</name><name>Elisabeth Moss</name><name>Rose Byrne</name><name>Colm Meaney</name><name>Sean Combs</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/universal/posters/gethimtothegreek_l201002091738.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/universal/posters/gethimtothegreek_xl201002091738.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="94275460">http://movies.apple.com/movies/universal/gethimtothegreek/gethimtothegreek-tlr_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3521"><info><title>The Good Guy</title><runtime>2:29</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Roadside Attractions</studio><postdate>2010-01-14</postdate><releasedate>2010-02-19</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 Roadside Attractions</copyright><director>Julio DePietro</director><description>Ambitious young Manhattanite and urban conservationist Beth (Alexis Bledel) wants it all: a good job, good friends, and a good guy to share the city with.

Laura suspects that Joe needs full-time care, but Jayne refuses to believe that their father’s condition is that serious. Jayne’s compulsion to escape reality only increases Laura’s attempts to yank her back down to earth. Meanwhile, Joe still sings and plays the blues on his prized guitar, and the lively widower even has a new “ladyfriend,” shameless and sassy Shelly (Ellen Barkin). But as the visible moments of their father’s impending senility increase, the family dynamics spiral out of control. Tensions flare as the close sisters must also juggle their own very different lives – Laura’s busy environmentalist work schedule and mother of three small children, and Jayne, desperate to finally have a baby with her workaholic art-dealing husband Jackson (Christian Camargo). Their adventures back home are not without magic, mischief and mayhem, and even a search for buried treasure in the backyard! In the end, any tears that Jayne and Laura might shed will be happy ones.</description></info><cast><name>Parker Posey</name><name>Demi Moore</name><name>Rip Torn</name><name>Ellen Barkin</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/happytears_l201001131241.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/happytears_xl201001131241.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="83623167">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/happytears/happytears-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3488"><info><title>Hot Tub Time Machine</title><runtime>1:29</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>MGM Studios</studio><postdate>2010-02-12</postdate><releasedate>2010-03-26</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 MGM Studios</copyright><director>Steve Pink</director><description>HOT TUB TIME MACHINE follows a group of best friends who’ve become bored with their adult lives: Adam (John Cusack) has been dumped by his girlfriend; Lou (Rob Corddry) is a party guy who can’t find the party; Nick’s (Craig Robinson) wife controls his every move; and video game-obsessed Jacob (Clark Duke) won’t leave his basement.

But when Jane and Jake find themselves out of town for their son’s college graduation, things start to get complicated. An innocent meal together turns into the unimaginable—an affair. With Jake remarried to the much younger Agness (Lake Bell), Jane is now, of all things, the other woman. Caught in the middle of their renewed romance is Adam (Martin), an architect hired to remodel Jane’s kitchen. Healing from a divorce of his own, Adam starts to fall for Jane, but soon realizes he’s become part of a love triangle.

As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name — Kick-Ass — assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. There’s only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers. His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes — including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (Chloë Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) — and forges a friendship with another fledgling superhero, Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).

In the name of his newly created religion, the great Russian novelist has renounced his noble title, his property and even his family in favor of poverty, vegetarianism and even celibacy. After she’s born him thirteen children! When Sofya then discovers that Tolstoy’s trusted disciple, Chertkov —whom she despises—may have secretly convinced her husband to sign a new will, leaving the rights to his iconic novels to the Russian people rather than his very own family, she is consumed by righteous outrage. This is the last straw. Using every bit of cunning, every trick of seduction in her considerable arsenal, she fights fiercely for what she believes is rightfully hers. </description></info><cast><name>Helen Mirren</name><name>Christopher Plummer</name><name>Paul Giamatti</name><name>James McAvoy</name><name>Kerry Condon</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Foreign</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/sony/posters/thelaststation_l201001041058.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/sony/posters/thelaststation_xl201001041058.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="75186630">http://movies.apple.com/movies/sony_pictures/thelaststation/thelaststation-tlr2_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3547"><info><title>Leaves of Grass</title><runtime>2:27</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>First Look Studios</studio><postdate>2010-02-11</postdate><releasedate>2010-04-02</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 First Look Studios</copyright><director>Tim Blake Nelson</director><description>When Ivy League classics professor Bill Kincaid receives news of the murder of his estranged identical twin brother, Brady (both played by two-time Academy Award® nominee Edward Norton), in a pot deal gone bad, he leaves the world of Northeastern academia to travel back to his home state of Oklahoma.

The relationship is purely a business arrangement at the outset, with Fisher paying for Jimmy’s time and attention, but when she discovers that she really loves him, she finds it impossible to re-write the rules and earn the affection she tried to buy. Howard’s ability to evoke the dueling strength and fragility of this quintessential Williams heroine, along with her stunning mastery of his lush, poetic language, firmly establish her as one of the best actresses of her generation, and place her Fisher Willow in a pantheon of performances that includes Vivien Leigh’s Blanche DuBois, Elizabeth Taylor’s Maggie the Cat, Anna Magnani’s Serafina delle Rose, and Geraldine Page’s Alexandra Del Lago.</description></info><cast><name>Bryce Dallas Howard</name><name>Chris Evans</name><name>Ellen Burstyn</name><name>Mamie Gummer</name><name>Ann-Margret</name><name>Will Patton</name><name>Jessica Collins</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/thelossofateardropdiamond_l200912141229.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/thelossofateardropdiamond_xl200912141229.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="93524006">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/thelossofateardropdiamond/lossofateardropdiamond-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3535"><info><title>MacGruber</title><runtime>2:30</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Universal Pictures</studio><postdate>2010-01-25</postdate><releasedate>2010-04-23</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 Universal Pictures</copyright><director>Jorma Taccone</director><description>Only one American hero has earned the rank of Green Beret, Navy SEAL and Army Ranger. Just one operative has been awarded 16 purple hearts, 3 Congressional Medals of Honor and 7 presidential medals of bravery. And only one guy is man enough to still sport a mullet. In 2010, Will Forte brings Saturday Night Live’s clueless soldier of fortune to the big screen in the action comedy MacGruber. In the 10 years since his fiancée was killed, special op MacGruber has sworn off a life of fighting crime with his bare hands. But when he learns that his country needs him to find a nuclear warhead that’s been stolen by his sworn enemy, Dieter Von Cunth (Val Kilmer), MacGruber figures he’s the only one tough enough for the job. Assembling an elite team of experts—Lt. Dixon Piper (Ryan Phillippe) and Vicki St. Elmo (Kristen Wiig)—MacGruber will navigate an army of assassins to hunt down Cunth and bring him to justice.  His methods may be unorthodox.  His crime scenes may get messy.  But if you want the world saved right, you call in MacGruber.</description></info><cast><name>Will Forte</name><name>Kristen Wiig</name><name>Ryan Phillippe</name><name>Powers Boothe</name><name>Maya Rudolph</name><name>Val Kilmer</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/universal/posters/macgruber_l201001251512.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/universal/posters/macgruber_xl201001251512.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="94895187">http://movies.apple.com/movies/universal/macgruber/macgruber-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3330"><info><title>The Men Who Stare At Goats</title><runtime>2:21</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Overture Films</studio><postdate>2009-08-27</postdate><releasedate>2009-11-06</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2009 Overture Films</copyright><director>Grant Heslov</director><description>In this quirky dark comedy inspired by a real life story you will hardly believe is actually true, astonishing revelations about a top-secret wing of the U.S. military come to light when a reporter encounters an enigmatic Special Forces operator on a mind-boggling mission. Reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is in search of his next big story when he encounters Lyn Cassady (Academy Award®winner George Clooney), a shadowy figure who claims to be part of an experimental U.S. military unit. According to Cassady, the New Earth Army is changing the way wars are fought. A legion of “Warrior Monks” with unparalleled psychic powers can read the enemy’s thoughts, pass through solid walls, and even kill a goat simply by staring at it. Now, the program’s founder, Bill Django (Oscar® nominee Jeff Bridges), has gone missing and Cassady’s mission is to find him. Intrigued by his new acquaintance’s far-fetched stories, Bob impulsively decides to accompany him on the search. When the pair tracks Django to a clandestine training camp run by renegade psychic Larry Hooper (two-time Oscar® winner Kevin Spacey), the reporter is trapped in the middle of a grudge match between the forces of Django’s New Earth Army and Hooper’s personal militia of super soldiers. In order to survive this wild adventure, Bob will have to outwit an enemy he never thought possible. The Men Who Stare at Goats was inspired by Jon Ronson’s non-fiction bestseller of the same name, an eye-opening and often hilarious exploration of the government’s attempts to harness paranormal abilities to combat its enemies.</description></info><cast><name>George Clooney</name><name>Jeff Bridges</name><name>Ewan McGregor</name><name>Kevin Spacey</name></cast><genre><name>Comedy</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/themenwhostareatgoats_l200911021451.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/independent/posters/themenwhostareatgoats_xl200911021451.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="88778085">http://movies.apple.com/movies/overture/themenwhostareatgoats/themenwhostareatgoats_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3534"><info><title>Mother</title><runtime>2:08</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Magnolia Pictures</studio><postdate>2010-01-22</postdate><releasedate>2010-03-12</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 Magnolia Pictures</copyright><director>Bong Joon-ho</director><description>Hye-ja is a single mom to 27-year-old Do-joon. Her son is her raison d’être. Though an adult in years, Do-joon is naïve and dependent on his mother, and a constant source of anxiety, often behaving in ways that are foolish or simply dangerous. Walking home alone one night down a nearly empty city street, he encounters a young girl who he follows for a while before she disappears into a dark alley.

Thanks to an inefficient lawyer and an apathetic police force, Do-joon’s case is quickly closed, but his mother refuses to let this be the end of the story. Trusting no one, Hye-ja’s maternal instincts kick into overdrive, and she sets out to find the girl’s killer and prove her son’s innocence.</description></info><cast><name>Kim Hye-ja</name><name>Won Bin</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Foreign</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/magnolia/posters/mother_l201001211107.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/magnolia/posters/mother_xl201001211107.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="74695954">http://movies.apple.com/movies/independent/mother/mother-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3381"><info><title>A Nightmare On Elm Street</title><runtime>2:04</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>New Line Cinema</studio><postdate>2009-10-05</postdate><releasedate>2010-04-30</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 New Line Cinema</copyright><director>Samuel Bayer</director><description>Freddy Krueger returns in “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” a contemporary reimagining of the horror classic.

In Fox Searchlight Pictures’ OUR FAMILY WEDDING, they learn the hard way that the path to saying “I do” can be rife with familial strife. When they return from college and too suddenly announce their marriage plans, they soon discover that their fathers - two highly competitive over-the-top egos - can wreak a major amount of havoc on their special day. With insults flying and tempers running high, it’s anyone’s guess if the alpha dads (Forest Whitaker and Carlos Mencia) will survive to make it down the aisle in one piece.

Set in Harlem in 1987, it is the story of Claireece “Precious” Jones (Gabourey Sidibe), a sixteen-year-old African-American girl born into a life no one would want. She’s pregnant for the second time by her absent father; at home, she must wait hand and foot on her mother (Mo’Nique), a poisonously angry woman who abuses her emotionally and physically. School is a place of chaos, and Precious has reached the ninth grade with good marks and an awful secret: she can neither read nor write. Precious may sometimes be down, but she is never out. Beneath her impassive expression is a watchful, curious young woman with an inchoate but unshakeable sense that other possibilities exist for her. Threatened with expulsion, Precious is offered the chance to transfer to an alternative school, Each One/Teach One. Precious doesn’t know the meaning of “alternative,” but her instincts tell her this is the chance she has been waiting for. In the literacy workshop taught by the patient yet firm Ms. Rain (Paula Patton), Precious begins a journey that will lead her from darkness, pain and powerlessness to light, love and self-determination.</description></info><cast><name>Mo’Nique</name><name>Paula Patton</name><name>Mariah Carey</name><name>Sherri Shepherd</name><name>Lenny Kravitz</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/lions_gate/posters/precious_l200911231120.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/lions_gate/posters/precious_xl200911231120.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="96683460">http://movies.apple.com/movies/lionsgate/precious/precious-tlr2a_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3144"><info><title>Princess and the Frog</title><runtime>2:00</runtime><rating>G</rating><studio>Walt Disney Pictures</studio><postdate>2009-05-10</postdate><releasedate>2009-12-11</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2009 Walt Disney Pictures</copyright><director>Ron Clements, John Musker</director><description>Walt Disney Animation Studios presents the musical THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, an animated comedy set in the great city of New Orleans.

Balthazar Blake (NICOLAS CAGE) is a master sorcerer in modern-day Manhattan trying to defend the city from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath (ALFRED MOLINA). Balthazar can’t do it alone, so he recruits Dave Stutler (JAY BARUCHEL), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as his reluctant protégé. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash course in the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely partners work to stop the forces of darkness. It’ll take all the courage Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the girl as he becomes THE SORCERER’S APPRENTICE.   The screenplay is by Matt Lopez and Doug Miro &amp; Carlo Bernard from a screen story by Matt Lopez and Larry Konner &amp; Mark Rosenthal.</description></info><cast><name>Nicolas Cage</name><name>Jay Baruchel</name><name>Alfred Molina</name><name>Teresa Palmer</name><name>Monica Bellucci</name><name>Toby Kebbell</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name><name>Fantasy</name></genre><poster><location>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/disney/posters/thesorcerersapprentice_l200912081418.jpg</location><xlarge>http://images.apple.com/moviesxml/s/disney/posters/thesorcerersapprentice_xl200912081418.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="94104216">http://movies.apple.com/movies/disney/thesorcerersapprentice/sorcerersapprentice-tlr1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="3440"><info><title>Spy Next Door</title><runtime>2:21</runtime><rating>PG</rating><studio>Lionsgate</studio><postdate>2009-11-19</postdate><releasedate>2010-01-15</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2010 Lionsgate</copyright><director>Brian Levant</director><description>Lionsgate’s family action comedy THE SPY NEXT DOOR stars Jackie Chan as Bob Ho, an undercover CIA superspy who decides to give up his career in espionage to settle down with his next-door neighbor and girlfriend, Gillian (Amber Valletta).

Reunited with his estranged father (Oscar® winner Anthony Hopkins), Talbot sets out to find his brother…and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Lawrence Talbot’s childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget.

He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline (Hugo Weaving) has come to investigate. As he pieces together the gory puzzle, he hears of an ancient curse that turns the afflicted into werewolves when the moon is full. Now, if he has any chance at ending the slaughter and protecting the woman he has grown to love, Talbot must destroy the vicious creature in the woods surrounding Blackmoor.
